# CHU-Shell
A UNIX shell implementation based on the UNIX bash. The shell has full support for all existing commands, I/O redirection, and pipelining capabilities.

To use: make the file using the provided makefile and proceed to execute the resulted binary file. From then the CHU-Shell should take over the existing shell. All command/program should work as expected. To exit the shell, CTRL+C to send an interrupt signal. <br \>
